# Description:

# This tool is only for use in a local dev environment setting where only a
# a single node, this one, is needed.

# A minor caveat with CouchDB 2.0 is by that each node is in a disabled state
# initially and as such the logs will complain about missing database tables
# until they # are created.

# This tool was created to address this problem for a local development
# cluster.  For production and clustering you should use the kubernetes
# sidecar container I've created that handles discovery and autoclustering,
# more info at: https://www.github.com/sip-li/docker-couchdb.

# How it works:

# The script first tests the environment for the variable: 'LOCAL_DEV_CLUSTER'.
# If present and evalutes to true, the script is run.  If not, the script is
# skipped entirely.

# If COUCHDB_ADMIN_USER and COUCHDB_ADMIN_PASS are defined in the environment
# an admin will first be created using those credentials. The admin is created
# using the 'enable_cluster' action of the 'cluster_setup' API endpoint.

# If they are missing then this step is skipped and the node will operate in
# 'admin party mode'.

# If the cluster is not finished (and missing the system databases such as:
# '_users', '_replicator', '_global_changes', the finish_cluster' action will
# be called on the 'cluster_setup' API endpoint.

# Note: the functions called from this script are present in:
#  /etc/profile.d/50-couch-functions.sh which was created at image build time.
# The 'couch' package is available because the shebang uses the '-l' argument.
